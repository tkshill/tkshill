### Code of Conduct

This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all community spaces, including the repository, associated projects, wiki and slack groups, both online and off. 
Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the repository maintainer(s).

Some repository spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants.
Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

#### Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

This community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The maintainer(s) reserves the right **not** to act on complaints regarding:
- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

#### Reporting
If you are being harassed by a contributor to this repository, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please alert the maintainer(s) as soon as possible. 
If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to this repository, but if you are being harassed by a collaborator of the repo outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. 
We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by any and all collabortors, especially the maintainers, seriously.
This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. 
The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from this repo based on their past behavior, including behavior outside repo spaces,
and behavior towards people who are not collaborators in this repository.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them,
if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of repository collaborators or the general public.
We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

#### Consequences
Collaborators asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a collaborator engages in harassing behavior, maintainer(s) may take any action they deem appropriate, 
up to and including expulsion from all repos and identification of the participant as a harasser to other repo contributors or the general public.
