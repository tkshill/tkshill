# Introduction

Thank you for so much for considering contributing to this repository. We really appreciate all the contributors who try to make this space better.

### Why we made this doc.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. 
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We also want to make it as easy as possible for newbies to start helping out and docs like this provide a valuable resource for them to use.

### What type of contributions we're looking for.

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, 
from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests,
or writing code which can be incorporated into the application codebase itself.

## Getting Started

If you're looking to start learning how to work with this repo, this doc tries to provide all the resources to get you from confusion to productivity.

We're not here to reinvent the wheel, so where we feel appropriate, we reference and link to resources we feel do a good job of helping a newbie through that particular section of setup.

Most of the docs are currently written using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to make it easy to add, modify, and edit what we need to.

We try not to take anything for granted, but in case we miss something, please reach out to the maintainers and let us know!

## Step 1. Setting up a Github Account

We're going to assume you know what [github](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) is about and how it works (otherwise, how would you be reading this?)

If you haven't made a github account as yet, make one [now](https://github.com). It's free!

## Step 2. Find/Make An Issue

Github uses a feature called _issues_. Issues are essentially a way to highlight bugs, features, problems, or any sort of suggestion or action you wish to happen on a github hosted project (you can find a more comprehensive explanation [here](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)).

We highly recommend looking at the existing repository issues to find a good open issue to start with. We always try to keep them populated with some beginner friendly issues that anyone can attempt to solve. We also use a `PR Submitted` tag to indicate when an Pull Request has been submitted for an issue, but it hasn't yet been merged, as most people would rather would on an issue with no attempted PRs yet.

If you feel like there's a contribution you would like to make that isn't represented by an already existing issue, feel free to create your own!

## Step 3. Creating a PR
At this point, you have two options.

**The first option** is using the github interface to fork the repo and submit a Pull Request (no code or terminals or IDE required). [This guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) shows just how to do that for a small personal repo. You would simply replace the step of creating a new repository to just navigating to this one and forking that instead. This is a great idea if you simply plan to add to or edit one of the markdown files we use for documentation in this project.

**The second option** is go the traditional route of forking the repo, creating a local copy of that fork, and working on your changes that way. This is also the only way to go if this project expands to include an associated application. For that we recommend [this guide](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/).

**Note:** The guide referenced above uses _master_ as the naming convention for the default branch in all its repos. In this project, _main_ is the default branch name. When following the instructions in the guide, simply replace _master_ with _main_ wherever it appears and it should proceed as normal. [this guide](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx) can help you transition with your own personal repos from master to main, and explains the methodology as to why you should.

## Step 5. Awaiting Review

Once you've submitted your pull request, the only thing left is to wait from feedback from one of the project maintainers. Since this is volunteer work for all of course, we ask for patience if you don't see a response immediately. Sometimes it takes about a day for someone's schedule to clear up to have the sit to properly review incoming PRs. We'd rather not rush a response after someone has put time and effort into submitted. If it's been over 24 hours and you haven't received any acknowledgement, you can post a message in the **#open-source** channel in the slack reminded of your PR, and someone will get back to you.

If the PR looks good, a maintainer will typically give feedback and merge the request immediately, otherwise they'll let you know what questions they have or what needs to change before your work can be accepted. Once it is, you'll see your changes on the main branch and VOILA, open source contribution complete!

## Step 6. Tips, Tricks and Gotchas

This section is just little notes and bits of info that can smooth over some of the bumps and hiccups that can come along with contributing.

- While this isn't absolutely required, we highly recommend **associating your Pull Requests with the Issue that they're intended to address**. This makes review much easier and avoids confusion when looking back at past commits. Github allows you to link a PR to an issue both during and after the PR's creation (the option should located in rightmost panel of the github PR interface).
- **Please do not hesitate to ask for help** in any part of this process if you feel confused. As soon as they can, project maintainers can try and get you through the parts which are confusing you. Just be aware that no one here is a github expert :), we're just folks happy and willing to help others get some experience.
- Be extra careful when working with git in the command line. Incorrectly typed names or commands can have strange results, and navigating git issues can be very perplexing. Fortunately, there's a plethora of resources on fixing said issues, and rest assured that any error you make has already been done, and solved, by someone.

That's all for now. If you feel like anything is missing from this document that you wish were included, let us know. Or hey, open up a fresh issue and take a shot at helping us make it better!


# How to report a bug
### A note on security
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email kirk.shilling@gmail.com instead.


### Bug report template
We have a bug report template already created for your use. Just select when opening up an issue on github

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?


### Feature Process

If you find yourself wishing for a feature you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. 
Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### How does a contribution get accepted

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a weekly basis.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community

All community discussions are currently done via issues.

# Additional Info

### Preferred Code style

Coming Eventually!

### Commit message conventions

We tend to use a `Type:Description` style for commit messages so it's easy to see what type of change is being made.
Common types are:
- DOCS - Creating of new documents
- FIX - Bug fixes
- EDIT - Usually a follow up commit if a small error was spotted in a previous version
- REFACTOR 

### Labelling Conventions

Coming soon!
