### Hey, I'm Kirk,  üèæ

I'm a full stack journeyman developer from the Caribbean who got his start with VBA and python, and now loves writing lots and lots of functional code. Primary languages are currently Elm, F#, and SQL with a lot of work in the .NET ecosystem and SQL Server. Writing software is genuinely one of my favourite feelings in the world and I'm searching for a space where I get to do some good.

#### What I've got going on

I'm trying to keep this space as a one stop shop for all things related to my programming journey so you can see my most recent articles in my [wiki](https://github.com/tkshill/tkshill/wiki)

You can also check out my hacktoberfest project [Quarto](https://github.com/tkshill/Quarto) which is a digital take on the popular board game of the same name, written (almost) entirely in Elm.

Last but not least, I'm grateful to be part of the [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/members/) Leadership Team. It's a wonderful space where devs all over the world come together to support each other, give talks, share successes, and just be their realm selves amongst encouraging peers. [Stop by](https://virtualcoffee.io/events/) anytime and say hello!

#### Contact

You can reach me at tkshillinz@icloud. I also frequent the Elm and F# slacks where you can find me as @Kirk Shillingford.

Be well.
