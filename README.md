## Hey, I'm Kirk, :wave:

I'm a full stack journeyman developer from the Caribbean who got his start with VBA and python, and now loves writing lots and lots of functional code. Primary languages are currently Elm, F#, and SQL with a lot of work in the .NET ecosystem and SQL Server. Also working with Typescript and React Native. Writing software is genuinely one of my favourite feelings in the world and I'm searching for a space where I get to do some good.

## What I've got going on

- Check out my pinned items below for a sampling of some of the projects and documentation I've been working on.

- Last but not least, I'm grateful to be doing a lot of community work as part of the [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/members/) Leadership Team. It's a wonderful space where devs all over the world come together to support each other, give talks, share successes, and just be their real selves amongst encouraging peers. If you're looking for a wholespace space online, [stop by](https://virtualcoffee.io/events/) anytime and say hello!
