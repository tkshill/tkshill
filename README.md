Hey, I'm Kirk 👋🏾

If you've found this page, welcome to my small corner of github. My name is Kirk and I like writing code, especially functional code. My code journey so far can be described as:
- a lot of spreadsheet automation with VBA
- a quite worrisome python obsession
- living that .NET life and falling in love with F# and SQL 
- front end work with Elmlang 

Ideally, this will be the landing page for all my software related projects, and probably a better write up of who I am and what I'm working on.

Coming soon, a static site built with Elm static pages.

Take care.
