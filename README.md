## Hey, I'm Kirk, :wave: 

I'm a full stack dev from the Caribbean who loves Functional programming and Domain Driven Development.

I got my start doing a lot of data driven work with VBA and Python.

Currently, I'm working with F#, C# and T-SQL (SQL Server) in the .NET ecosystem. 

Also working with Elm, Typescript and React Native on the front-end.

I do technical writing at [Arctype](https://arctype.com/blog/author/kirk/)

Mostly I'm just trying to do good work and practice kindness in my habits.

## What I've got going on
