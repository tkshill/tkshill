# TEMPLATE OSS REPOSITORY


## Description

This repo serves as an example for anyone wondering about the basic requirements necessary to set up an open source repository. The Issues, pull requests, supporting docs and [templates](https://github.com/tkshill/Template/tree/main/.github) are all meant to guides/resources for those wishing to create healthy spaces for contributions.

To see a more detailed breakdown of the open source process check out [this wiki](https://github.com/tkshill/Template/wiki/A-Starter-Guide-to-Open-Source-Project-Maintenance) of the template project detailing tools and tips for OSS maintenance and contributions.

Topics covered in the Wiki:

- How to communicate well with contributors
- Avoiding burnout as a maintainer
- Links to long form content on OSS development
